# n_body_simulation
Built custom physics engine for n particles interacting via gravity. Supports nonelastic collisions to simulate the formation of larger particle clusters, representing astronomical "objects." The mass distribution is calculated after a certain time, in an attempt to reproduce and gain insight into the mass spectrum of the universe.

A mass spectrum is essentially a function $\phi(m)$, where there are $\phi(m)$ number of objects with mass $m$. In 1955, Salpeter found that the distribution of stellar masses closely follows a power law, with exponent -2.35. It turns out that many objects in the universe tend to follow a very similar power law, with exponent -2. This project aims to provide insight towards the appearance of this exponent by simulating object formation through particle collisions.
