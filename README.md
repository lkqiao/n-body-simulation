# n_body_simulation
Custom physics engine for n particles interacting via gravity and implements nonelastic collisions to simulate the formation of larger objects. The mass distribution is calculated after a certain time, in order to reproduce Salpeter's IMF. Project inspired by: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaLwBdRXslM&amp;ab_channel=PhysicsfortheBirds.
