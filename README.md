# n_body_simulation
Built custom physics engine for n particles interacting via gravity. Supports nonelastic collisions to simulate the formation of larger particle clusters, representing astronomical "objects." The mass distribution is calculated after a certain time, in an attempt to reproduce and gain deeper insight into the "universal" mass spectrum.

A mass spectrum is essentially a plot of mass and the number of objects with that mass. In 1955, Salpeter found that the distribution of stellar masses closely follows a power law, with exponent -2.35. It turns out that many objects in the universe tend to follow a very similar power law, with exponent -2. This project aims to provide insight into the origins of this exponent, by simulating object formation through particle collisions.
